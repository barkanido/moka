Moka is a fast, concurrent cache library for Rust. Moka is inspired by
[Caffeine][caffeine-git] (Java) and [Ristretto][ristretto-git] (Go).

Moka provides cache implementations that support full concurrency of retrievals and
a high expected concurrency for updates. Moka also provides a not thread-safe cache
implementation for single thread applications.

All caches perform a best-effort bounding of a  hash map using an entry
replacement algorithm to determine which entries to evict when the capacity is
exceeded.

## Features

- Thread-safe, highly concurrent in-memory cache implementations:
    - Blocking caches that can be shared across OS threads.
    - An asynchronous (futures aware) cache that can be accessed inside and outside
      of asynchronous contexts.
- A not thread-safe, in-memory cache implementation for single thread applications.
- Caches are bounded by the maximum number of entries.
- Maintains good hit rate by using an entry replacement algorithms inspired by
  [Caffeine][caffeine-git]:
    - Admission to a cache is controlled by the Least Frequently Used (LFU) policy.
    - Eviction from a cache is controlled by the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy.
- Supports expiration policies:
    - Time to live
    - Time to idle


## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
moka = "0.5"
```

To use the asynchronous cache, enable a crate feature called "future".

```toml
[dependencies]
moka = { version = "0.5", features = ["future"] }
```


## Example: Synchronous Cache

The thread-safe, blocking caches are defined in the `sync` module.

Cache entries are manually added using `insert` method, and are stored in the cache
until either evicted or manually invalidated.

Here's an example of reading and updating a cache by using multiple threads:

```rust
// Use the synchronous cache.
use moka::sync::Cache;

use std::thread;

fn value(n: usize) -> String {
    format!("value {}", n)
}

fn main() {
    const NUM_THREADS: usize = 16;
    const NUM_KEYS_PER_THREAD: usize = 64;

    // Create a cache that can store up to 10,000 entries.
    let cache = Cache::new(10_000);

    // Spawn threads and read and update the cache simultaneously.
    let threads: Vec<_> = (0..NUM_THREADS)
        .map(|i| {
            // To share the same cache across the threads, clone it.
            // This is a cheap operation.
            let my_cache = cache.clone();
            let start = i * NUM_KEYS_PER_THREAD;
            let end = (i + 1) * NUM_KEYS_PER_THREAD;

            thread::spawn(move || {
                // Insert 64 entries. (NUM_KEYS_PER_THREAD = 64)
                for key in start..end {
                    my_cache.insert(key, value(key));
                    // get() returns Option<String>, a clone of the stored value.
                    assert_eq!(my_cache.get(&key), Some(value(key)));
                }

                // Invalidate every 4 element of the inserted entries.
                for key in (start..end).step_by(4) {
                    my_cache.invalidate(&key);
                }
            })
        })
        .collect();

    // Wait for all threads to complete.
    threads.into_iter().for_each(|t| t.join().expect("Failed"));

    // Verify the result.
    for key in 0..(NUM_THREADS * NUM_KEYS_PER_THREAD) {
        if key % 4 == 0 {
            assert_eq!(cache.get(&key), None);
        } else {
            assert_eq!(cache.get(&key), Some(value(key)));
        }
    }
}
```


## Example: Asynchronous Cache

The asynchronous (futures aware) cache is defined in the `future` module.
It works with asynchronous runtime such as [Tokio][tokio-crate],
[async-std][async-std-crate] or [actix-rt][actix-rt-crate].
To use the asynchronous cache, [enable a crate feature called "future"](#usage).

[tokio-crate]: https://crates.io/crates/tokio
[async-std-crate]: https://crates.io/crates/asinc-std
[actix-rt-crate]: https://crates.io/crates/actix-rt

Cache entries are manually added using an insert method, and are stored in the cache
until either evicted or manually invalidated:

- Inside an async context (`async fn` or `async` block), use `insert` or `invalidate`
  method for updating the cache and `await` them.
- Outside any async context, use `blocking_insert` or `blocking_invalidate`
  methods. They will block for a short time under heavy updates.

Here is a similar program to the previous example, but using asynchronous cache with
[Tokio][tokio-crate] runtime:

```rust,ignore
// Cargo.toml
//
// [dependencies]
// moka = { version = "0.5", features = ["future"] }
// tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros" ] }
// futures = "0.3"

// Use the asynchronous cache.
use moka::future::Cache;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    const NUM_TASKS: usize = 16;
    const NUM_KEYS_PER_TASK: usize = 64;

    fn value(n: usize) -> String {
        format!("value {}", n)
    }

    // Create a cache that can store up to 10,000 entries.
    let cache = Cache::new(10_000);

    // Spawn async tasks and write to and read from the cache.
    let tasks: Vec<_> = (0..NUM_TASKS)
        .map(|i| {
            // To share the same cache across the async tasks, clone it.
            // This is a cheap operation.
            let my_cache = cache.clone();
            let start = i * NUM_KEYS_PER_TASK;
            let end = (i + 1) * NUM_KEYS_PER_TASK;

            tokio::spawn(async move {
                // Insert 64 entries. (NUM_KEYS_PER_TASK = 64)
                for key in start..end {
                    // insert() is an async method, so await it.
                    my_cache.insert(key, value(key)).await;
                    // get() returns Option<String>, a clone of the stored value.
                    assert_eq!(my_cache.get(&key), Some(value(key)));
                }

                // Invalidate every 4 element of the inserted entries.
                for key in (start..end).step_by(4) {
                    // invalidate() is an async method, so await it.
                    my_cache.invalidate(&key).await;
                }
            })
        })
        .collect();

    // Wait for all tasks to complete.
    futures::future::join_all(tasks).await;

    // Verify the result.
    for key in 0..(NUM_TASKS * NUM_KEYS_PER_TASK) {
        if key % 4 == 0 {
            assert_eq!(cache.get(&key), None);
        } else {
            assert_eq!(cache.get(&key), Some(value(key)));
        }
    }
}
```


## Avoiding to clone the value at `get`

For the concurrent caches (`sync` and `future` caches), the return type of `get`
method is `Option<V>` instead of `Option<&V>`, where `V` is the value type. Every
time `get` is called for an existing key, it creates a clone of the stored value `V`
and returns it. This is because the `Cache` allows concurrent updates from threads so
a value stored in the cache can be dropped or replaced at any time by any other
thread. `get` cannot return a reference `&V` as it is impossible to guarantee the
value outlives the reference.

If you want to store values that will be expensive to clone, wrap them by
`std::sync::Arc` before storing in a cache. [`Arc`][rustdoc-std-arc] is a thread-safe
reference-counted pointer and its `clone()` method is cheap.

[rustdoc-std-arc]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Arc.html

```rust,ignore
use std::sync::Arc;

let key = ...
let large_value = vec![0u8; 2 * 1024 * 1024]; // 2 MiB

// When insert, wrap the large_value by Arc.
cache.insert(key.clone(), Arc::new(large_value));

// get() will call Arc::clone() on the stored value, which is cheap.
cache.get(&key);
```


## Example: Expiration Policies

Moka supports the following expiration policies:

- **Time to live**: A cached entry will be expired after the specified duration past
  from `insert`.
- **Time to idle**: A cached entry will be expired after the specified duration past
  from `get` or `insert`.

To set them, use the `CacheBuilder`.

```rust
use moka::sync::CacheBuilder;

use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let cache = CacheBuilder::new(10_000) // Max 10,000 elements
        // Time to live (TTL): 30 minutes
        .time_to_live(Duration::from_secs(30 * 60))
        // Time to idle (TTI):  5 minutes
        .time_to_idle(Duration::from_secs( 5 * 60))
        // Create the cache.
        .build();

    // This entry will expire after 5 minutes (TTI) if there is no get().
    cache.insert(0, "zero");

    // This get() will extend the entry life for another 5 minutes.
    cache.get(&0);

    // Even though we keep calling get(), the entry will expire
    // after 30 minutes (TTL) from the insert().
}
```


## Hashing Algorithm

By default, a cache uses a hashing algorithm selected to provide resistance against
HashDoS attacks.

The default hashing algorithm is the one used by `std::collections::HashMap`, which
is currently SipHash 1-3, though this is subject to change at any point in the
future.

While its performance is very competitive for medium sized keys, other hashing
algorithms will outperform it for small keys such as integers as well as large keys
such as long strings. However those algorithms will typically not protect against
attacks such as HashDoS.

The hashing algorithm can be replaced on a per-`Cache` basis using the
`build_with_hasher` method of the `CacheBuilder`. Many alternative algorithms are
available on crates.io, such as the [aHash][ahash-crate] crate.

## Minimum Supported Rust Versions

This crate's minimum supported Rust versions (MSRV) are the followings:

| Feature    | Enabled by default? | MSRV        |
|:-----------|:-------------------:|:-----------:|
| no feature |                     | Rust 1.45.2 |
| `atomic64` |       yes           | Rust 1.45.2 |
| `future`   |                     | Rust 1.46.0 |

If only the default features are enabled, MSRV will be updated conservatively. When
using other features, like `future`, MSRV might be updated more frequently, up to the
latest stable. In both cases, increasing MSRV is _not_ considered a semver-breaking
change.

<!--
- socket2 0.4.0 requires 1.46.
- quanta requires 1.45.
- moka-cht requires 1.41.
-->


## Resolving Compile Errors on Some 32-bit Platforms

On some 32-bit target platforms including the followings, you may encounter compile
errors:

- `armv5te-unknown-linux-musleabi`
- `mips-unknown-linux-musl`
- `mipsel-unknown-linux-musl`

```console
error[E0432]: unresolved import `std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64`
  --> ... /moka-0.5.3/src/sync.rs:10:30
   |
10 |         atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicU64, Ordering},
   |                              ^^^^^^^^^
   |                              |
   |                              no `AtomicU64` in `sync::atomic`
```

Such errors can occur because `std::sync::atomic::AtomicU64` is not provided on these
platforms but Moka uses it.

You can resolve the errors by disabling `atomic64` feature, which is one of the
default features of Moka. Edit your Cargo.toml to add `default-features = false`
to the dependency declaration.

```toml:Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
moka = { version = "0.5", default-feautures = false }
# Or
moka = { version = "0.5", default-feautures = false, features = ["future"] }
```

This will make Moka to switch to a fall-back implementation, so it will compile.
